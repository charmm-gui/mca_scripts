# `axolemma/`

Used in preparation of axolemma and polymer systems, which both used previous simulations as a starting point.

# `benchmark/`

Used to perform benchmark with MCA and PACKMOL. Includes initial coordinates and CHARMM scripts distributed with MCA, with one slight modification to handle arbitrary volume fractions (see `test_box_dims.str`).

# `co2_diffusion/`

CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion calculations.

# `lipid_diffusion/`

Mica + POPC lipid diffusion calculations.

# `misc_analysis/`

Produce various plots or plot precursors, some of which appear in MCA manuscript.

# `images/`

Some aggregate statistics were collected here, as well as the gnuplot scripts to produce most plot images.

# `images/pretty`

Scripts to produce high-quality rendered images in VMD with GPU-accelerated TachyonL-OptiX.
